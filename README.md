# loan-prediction

In today’s world, obtaining loans from financial institutions has become a very common phenomenon. Every day many people apply for loans, for a variety of purposes. But not all the applicants are reliable, and not everyone can be approved. Every year, there are cases where people do not repay the bulk of the loan amount to the bank which results in huge financial loss. The risk associated with making a decision on a loan approval is immense. Loans are the core business of banks. The main profit comes directly from the loan’s interest. The loan companies grant a loan after an intensive process of verification and validation. However, they still don’t have assurance if the applicant is able to repay the loan with no difficulties.
Hence, the main purpose of the project is that predict if a person would be able to repay the loan or not. In other words, the goal is to predict if the person would be a eligible for loan or not.
In this Project, we have build a predictive model to predict if an applicant is able to repay the lending company or not. We will prepare the data using Jupyter Notebook and use various models to predict the target variable.
